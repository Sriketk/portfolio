MDX combines the simplicity of Markdown with the power of React components. It's perfect for building content-rich sites like blogs and documentation where you want the ease of writing in Markdown but occasionally need the flexibility of custom components.

## Why MDX?

Markdown is great for writing, but sometimes you need more than just formatted text. Maybe you want to embed an interactive chart, add a custom callout box, or include a video player. MDX lets you do all of this while keeping the writing experience simple.

## Setting Up MDX in Next.js

Next.js has excellent support for MDX through the `@next/mdx` package. You can configure it to work with the App Router, allowing you to create pages directly from MDX files or import MDX content into your React components.

```javascript
import createMDX from '@next/mdx'

const withMDX = createMDX({
  extension: /\.mdx?$/,
  options: {
    remarkPlugins: [],
    rehypePlugins: [],
  },
})

export default withMDX(nextConfig)
```

## Custom Components

One of the best features of MDX is the ability to provide custom components for standard Markdown elements. Want all your links to open in a new tab? Want to add syntax highlighting to code blocks? You can do all of this by providing a components object.

## Content Organization

For a blog, you might organize your MDX files in a `content/posts` directory. Each file becomes a blog post, with frontmatter for metadata like title, date, and excerpt. You can then use Node.js file system APIs to read and parse these files at build time.
