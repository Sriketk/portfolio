For most of my youth up until 4th grade, I moved alot. I often wonder how different I would have ended up if I was born up in the same area all my life.

I think moving around alot at a young age is bad. I feel like in order ot learn, it helps being exposed to a constant for a long period so you are able to question and understand things why they are. Also people too. It was hard making and keeping friends so I wonder how much learning children recieve form one another. For me it was none. I think thats also why I struggled in education at a younger age. I remember my grades not being good. 

It was a long time ago, and obviously theres like no way I could analyze what I was thinking and opinions, but I felt like not much was going on there. 

We moved to Charlotte around the 4th grade, and this was the first time we stayed put for a long time. There was nothing I was really interested in around that age. Nothing that I can remember. I moved to a new school, and this was the first time I felt social dynamics. The cool kids. 

I felt like from this age, I was constantly worried about others thought of me. I'm sure alot of other kids felt the same way, but I felt like since i had no interests my interests were often shaped by stigmatism as opposed to curiosity. 

I think this is why I was not really good at anything growing up. I did things cause that was socially acceptable. I was a pretty average student, but I tried to take very advanced classes. Not because I loved education and was very curious about learning, but thats what people around me at the time were doing and what I felt like they respected. 

I remember feeling good when I told my friends I was taking 7 AP classes. Even on exams. I felt like I studied so I could converse with my peers about test or homework answers. All a social game. I studied out of wanting good grades not out of curiosity. And I felt like I definitely wasnt super innately intelligent and this led to me getting ok grades. 

This carried to college as well. I got into a mediocre college. College was different though. After exams, people didn't discuss that much and honestly I felt like people didn't share that much. It was pretty hard making friends in college, maybe cause of covid. But people acted with alot more agency in College. They did alot more stuff out of interest. I did as well. I studied Computer science, because I heard there was alot of money in that field, but also because it was super respected major at the time. I actually wonder if I would have chosen it if it wasnt super respectbale. Again I got a little kick when telling people I was CS major. A little ray of self-encouragement. 

Due to people not caring much about others academically, I spent alot less tiem studying. I procrastinated alot more. I spent most of my time playing basketball, cause thats what I wanted to do at the time. I met my best friends playing basketball. I dont regret any of that time to be honest. I spent like 4-5 hours a day playing basketball. 

Academically, it was not the best. My grades were just good enough to pass. Below average. My academic circle reflected that as well. Everyone was just trying to do enough just to get by. 

This took a real toll when applying to jobs and internships. With jobs being super selective, people didnt share much about the process until its time to share their offers. People wouldnt share about application process or what they were doing while they were doing it. I struggled very hard here. I never did any learning or exploration outside of work. I did the bare minimum and put the projects I did in my class as "side projects." This failed extremely hard. 

By the time I was a senior year, I had no real internships, and I was genuinely concerned about not being able to land a job. I would read stories on reddit r/csjobs on people having to uber cause they werent able to land jobs. The greater the gap between it was from graduating and not having a job, the worse it is.

I also kind felt the weight of my parents around this time as well. They fought the struggle of moving countries for a better future and me not being able to land a job was a super bad look. Whener I would be home for break during that period, I felt super akward sitting in the living room as my parents just walked past. The silence was loud. 

I had to lock in. I applied to over 2000 jobs. In retrosepct, I still didn't lock in correcty. I thought grinding was applying to more jobs. I actually didn't even learn anything. I did a shit ton of leetcode, but I actually didnt do substantial things outside. I didnt even know fr. 

With the grace of god, I was able to land a job. My only offer. Entry level software engineering position for Ally Financial. That was honestly the most happy I had ever been. I was lucky enough to get it early in the last semester of college, so I didnt have to worry that much. The job was in my home state as well and I was very pumped at the time about saving money on rent. 

Fast forward to me working, I was very driven to be a high achiever. Again honestly cause of social reasons, I wanted my boss to respect me. I was also placed in alot of conversations and discussions where I didnt understand what was going on. And this really irked me. The feeling of being part of a conversation and not being able to participate. Just praying I wasn't asked to share my thoughts. This caused me to grind extremely hard. I was working weekends and late nights. I wanted to be a master. 

I achieved it. i was a high performer on my team. But this also exposed alot of things about the work that we were doing. I realized that often my seniors work was very low quality. I found my self in situations where I was teaching them how to do things. An example was docker. I didnt know anything about docker and it got to a point where I coudlnt rely on the dev ops people in my team anymore cause they coudlnt figure it out. I had to spend hours and learn it my self. Our code base was fucking trash. And somehow I got to a point where i was attending more meetings than I was doing work and learning within my work hours. 

I had to grind extra hard outside of work to continue learning. This especially if I ever wanted to be part of a better organization. I felt like I was wasting time in my 9-5. I took a bet on my self. This is probably the boldest thing I have ever done, but it didn't feel like it.

I felt like if I didnt quit I would be stuck and wouldnt be able to move as fast. It didnt feel bold to be honest. It felt like it was the only option. 

What was the worst that couuld happen. worst case I failed and I learned. I'm driven internally to be great. Cause i want to be able to build something. I feel like I can build anything. There are just so many resources, and I figured out how to read documentation and learn anything. Especially with AI, the opportunity is wide open, and I need to take it.

I also want to live a better life. I cant do this from Charlotte. I need to move ot New York. I do this cause I want to be around people doing great things. I want to be proud of my efforts. I want to be able to construct something that did not exist before. 

If i work for a company especially a lowly one, I feel like it will always feel like I am working. As I'm building Cobalt, it does not feel like work.
