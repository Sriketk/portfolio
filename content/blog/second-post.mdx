Typography is the foundation of web design. Before images, before animations, before any visual flourish, there are words. And how those words are presented can make or break a user's experience.

## Choosing Typefaces

The typefaces you choose set the tone for your entire design. A serif font like Crimson Pro brings elegance and readability to long-form content. A sans-serif like Inter provides clarity and modernity for UI elements and shorter text.

## Creating Hierarchy

Good typography creates a clear hierarchy that guides readers through your content. This hierarchy is established through:

- **Size**: Larger text naturally draws the eye first
- **Weight**: Bold text stands out from regular weight
- **Color**: Darker text appears more important than muted text
- **Spacing**: More space around an element gives it prominence

## Line Length and Spacing

The ideal line length for readability is typically 50-75 characters. Too short and the eye has to jump too frequently; too long and it's easy to lose your place. Line height (leading) should be around 1.5-1.6 times the font size for body text.

## Responsive Typography

Typography needs to adapt to different screen sizes. What works on desktop might be too large on mobile. Use responsive units and consider how your type scale adjusts across breakpoints.
