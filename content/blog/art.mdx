I just came back from watching Hamnet, and I had a great experience. I was very happy that I was able to consume it and stay present.

When I first started getting into movies, I would try to watch a movie every night during the summer. This was during my letterboxd obsession, and I felt like the summer was my time to make my dent on the vast filmography or I would never get to them.

This was a terrible idea. I viewed watching movies as another thing I needed to do, rather than a medium of art. I wasn't even able to enjoy alot of the movies. I wasn't able to focus, and more focused about what I was going to say about the movie more than actually watching it. 

I was also watching movies as part of a routine. I wasn't doing much outside. I would go the gym, study, and watch a movie. That was all I did that entire summer. 

I realized it back then, but I can confirm now that you need to experience life for these movies to resonate. You need to work on something you care about. you need to experience hardships, breakups, and frustrations. Art is often made in response to artists expressing them selves in response their problems. In order to resonate with art, you need to experience the same thing.
